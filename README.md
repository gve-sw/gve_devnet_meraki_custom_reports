# GVE DevNet Meraki Custom Reports
This prototype utilizes the Meraki dashboard APIs to automatically retrieve Meraki information. A Python script is used to generate Excel reports containing the Meraki devices information. The generated reports for each organization are saved in the `Reports` folder, and the main report that includes all organization is generated in the main repository folder (each organization information is saved in a separate sheet). The reports then can be exported to PowerBI for visualization.

## Prerequisites
#### Meraki API Keys
In order to use the Meraki API, you need to enable the API for your organization first. After enabling API access, you can generate an API key. Follow these instructions to enable API access and generate an API key:
1. Login to the Meraki dashboard
2. In the left-hand menu, navigate to `Organization > Settings > Dashboard API access`
3. Click on `Enable access to the Cisco Meraki Dashboard API`
4. Go to `My Profile > API access`
5. Under API access, click on `Generate API key`
6. Save the API key in a safe place. The API key will only be shown once for security purposes, so it is very important to take note of the key then. In case you lose the key, then you have to revoke the key and a generate a new key. Moreover, there is a limit of only two API keys per profile.

> Note: You can add your account as Full Organization Admin to your organizations by following the instructions [here](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions).


## Installation/Configuration
1. Clone this repository with `git clone [repository name]`. To find the repository name, click the green `Code` button above the repository files. Then, the dropdown menu will show the https domain name. Click the copy button to the right of the domain name to get the value to replace [repository name] placeholder.

2. Add Meraki API key and base url to environment variables
```python
API_KEY = "API key goes here"
MERAKI_BASE_URL="URL here"
```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment. Make sure Python 3 is installed in your environment, and if not, you may download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python 3 is installed in your environment, you can activate the virtual environment with the instructions found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
4. Install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
